# Music Genre Recognition


### Cathy Guang, Katrina Li


## Music classification has many potential applications. It enables the user to search the genre of music they are interested in. Also, music can be managed more efficiently and effectively once they are categorized. It would also become a milestone for potential future studies such as mood, instrumentation or style classification.  Music genre recognition is a non-trivial issue because the boundaries between genres are fuzzy. In this project we will train a deep learning model to recognize the genre of a piece of music, in one of the ten genres listed below: blues, classical, country, disco, hiphop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae and rock. We will train this model by feeding it the music input in the form of mel frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC).
